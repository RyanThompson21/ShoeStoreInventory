# The Shoe Store

This project consists of five screens:

1. Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus create and login buttons
2. Welcome onboarding screen
3. Instructions onboarding screen
4. Shoe Listing screen
5. Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe

 On the login screen, both the login and create buttons navigate to the welcome screen, since the app does not have internet functionality. The welcome and instructions pages just have text and a button to navigate onward, both were required by the project spec. The Shoe list screen displays the inventory as a scrollable list by adding a new TextView for each item. New shoes are added to the inventory via the ShoeDetail page, where the user simply fills out a form with some basic information about the shoe (company, name, size, description).
